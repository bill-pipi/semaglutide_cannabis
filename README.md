**Figure 1a.**  Comparison of incident CUD diagnosis (new diagnosis) in patients with obesity who had no prior history of CUD between propensity-score matched Semaglutide and Non-GLP-1RA anti-obesity medications cohorts, stratified by gender, age group, race and the status of type 2 diabetes. Outcomes were followed for 12 months following the index event (first prescription of semaglutide or non-GLP-1 RA anti-obesity medications during 6/2021-12/2022). Hazard rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate the probability of outcome at daily time intervals with censoring applied. Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the 12-month time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window.

**Figure 1b.**  Comparison of medical encounters for CUD diagnosis (recurrent CUD diagnosis) in patients with obesity who had a prior history of CUD between propensity-score matched Semaglutide and Non-GLP-1RA anti-obesity medications cohorts, stratified by gender, age group, race and the status of type 2 diabetes. Outcomes were followed for 12 months following the index event (first prescription of semaglutide or non-GLP-1 RA anti-obesity medications during 6/2021-12/2022). Hazard rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate the probability of outcome at daily time intervals with censoring applied. Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the 12-month time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window.

**Figure 2a.** Comparison of incident CUD diagnosis (new diagnosis) in patients with type 2 diabetes who had no prior history of CUD between propensity-score matched Semaglutide and Non-GLP-1RA anti-diabetes medications cohorts, stratified by gender, age group, race and the status of obesity. Outcomes were followed for 12 months following the index event (first prescription of semaglutide or non-GLP-1 RA anti-diabetes medications during 12/2017-5/2021). Hazard rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate the probability of outcome at daily time intervals with censoring applied. Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the 12-month time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window.

**Figure 3.**  Comparison of incident and recurrent CUD in patients with T2D at longer follow-up between propensity-score matched Semaglutide and non-GLP-1RA anti-diabetes medications cohorts. Hazard rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate the probability of outcome at daily time intervals with censoring applied. Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the follow-up time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window.
