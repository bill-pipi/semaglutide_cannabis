----------
**Figure 1a.**  Comparison of incident CUD diagnosis in patients with overweight/obesity who had no prior history of CUD between propensity-score matched semaglutide and non-GLP1R agonist anti-obesity medications cohorts. Outcomes were followed for 8 months after the index event (first prescription of semaglutide or non-GLP-1 RA anti-obesity medications during 6/2021-12/2022). Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the 8-month time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window.

**Figure 1b.**  Comparison of recurrent CUD diagnosis in patients with overweight/obesity who had a prior history of CUD between propensity-score matched semaglutide and non-GLP1R agonist anti-obesity medications cohorts. Outcomes were followed for 8 months after the index event (first prescription of semaglutide or non-GLP-1 RA anti-obesity medications during 6/2021-12/2022). Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the 8-month time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window.

**Figure 2a.** Comparison of incident CUD diagnosis in patients with T2DM who had no prior history of CUD between propensity-score matched semaglutide and non-GLP1R agonist anti-diabetes medications cohorts. Outcomes were followed within an 8-month time window after the index event (first prescription of semaglutide or non-GLP-1 RA anti-diabetes medications in 12/2017-5/2021). Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the 8-month time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window.

**Figure 2b.** Comparison of recurrent CUD diagnosis in patients with T2DM who had a prior history of CUD between propensity-score matched semaglutide and non-GLP1R agonist anti-diabetes medications cohorts. Outcomes were followed within an 8-month time window after the index event (first prescription of semaglutide or non-GLP-1 RA anti-diabetes medications in 12/2017-5/2021). Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the 8-month time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window.


**Figure 3.**  Comparison of incident and recurrent CUD in patients with T2DM at different follow-up time periods between propensity-score matched semaglutide and non-GLP1R agonist anti-diabetes medications cohorts. Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the follow-up time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window. Hazard rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate the probability of outcome at daily time intervals with censoring applied.
